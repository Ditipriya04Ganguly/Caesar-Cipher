# Caesar-Cipher
#Encryption is the process of scrambling a message so that
only the intended recipient can read it. With the fast
progression of digital data exchange in electronic way,
Information Security is becoming much more important in
data storage and transmission. Caesar cipher is a mono
alphabetic cipher. It is a type of substitution cipher in which
each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter. In this paper,
author modified the traditional Caesar cipher and fixed the
key size as one. Another thing alphabet index is checked if the
alphabet index is even then increase the value by one else
alphabet index is odd decrease the key value by one.
